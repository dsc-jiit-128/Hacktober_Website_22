        <p class="gdsc">Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) is a Google Developers program for university students to learn mobile and web development skills. 
            The clubs are open to any student, ranging from novice developers who are just starting, to advanced developers who want to further their skills. 
            The clubs are intended as a space for students to try out new ideas and collaborate to solve mobile and web development problems.</p>

                    <p class="devtext">With the modernization and digitisation of the healthcare system, the need for exchanging medical data has become increasingly compelling. 
                     Biomedical imaging has been no exception, where the gathering of medical imaging acquisitions from multi-site collaborations have enabled to reach data sizes never imaginable until few years ago.
                     Usually, medical imaging data have very large volume and diverse complexity, requiring bespoken transfer systems that protect personal information as well as data integrity.
                     Despite many digital innovations, there are still technical and regulatory bottlenecks that make biomedical imaging data exchange challenging. 
                     Here we present Bitbox, a web-based application which provides a reliable yet straightforward service to securely exchange medical imaging data. With Bitbox, both imaging and non-imaging data any type can be transferred from any external and independent site into a centralized server.
                     A showcase of the system will be illustrated for the COVID-19 Clinical Neuroscience Study (COVID-CNS) project, a UK-wide experimental medicine study to investigate the neurological and neuropsychiatric effects of COVID-19 infections in hundreds of patients. </p>

            <p class="marktext">30 Days of Google Cloud program will provide you an opportunity to kickstart your career in cloud and get hands-on practice on Google Cloud - the tool that powers apps like Google Search, Gmail and YouTube.
                Google Cloud in collaboration with Developer Students Club (DSC) provides an opportunity to students to start their journey in cloud programming with hands-on labs on Google Cloud Platform Along the way, you will learn and practice cloud concepts like computing, big data, application developments, and machine learning. It usually takes place in October every year, as the name suggests the duration of this program is 30 days. 
                It consists of several quests (collection of labs) that need to be completed in a stipulated time.</p>
