# Hacktober_Website_22

This website contains different issues. Contributor's job is to find the problems and raise issues regarding it. He/She can contribute to the website by fixing the issues. This can be done by forking the repository on your own remote repository, making the required changes in the project and creating pull requests to merge your changes in the original repository. All this will be showcased to you in the git session with the hands on experience where you can practically do it by operating and fixing issues of this website. 

This session is organised keeping in mind about the Hacktober Fest that is organised between 3rd Oct to 25th Oct. It is one of the biggest opportunity to contribute in open source, gain experience and earn cool swags. All participants will get swag from Hacktoberfest organizers if they create at least 4 pull requests between the stiipulated days. There are different open source projects where you can contribute according to your interests and the top contributors will get extra benefits and prizes from the project owners. 

Therefore , this git session is a wonderful opportunity to learn the git concepts and github interface and apply it in the fest which will pave the way for your developer's journey.
